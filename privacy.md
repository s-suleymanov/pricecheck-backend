Privacy Policy for PriceCheck Extension
Last updated: September 1, 2025

Thank you for choosing PriceCheck. This privacy policy explains what information our extension handles and why. Our goal is to provide a useful service while respecting your privacy.

Information We Collect
PriceCheck is designed to be private and secure. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). We do not track your browsing history.

When you activate the extension on a supported product page (e.g., Amazon.com), the extension's script reads the following non-personal information from the page:
1. Product UPC (Universal Product Code)
2. Product ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)
3. Product Title
This information is related only to the product being viewed and is not linked to you or your account in any way.

How We Use Information
The collected product information (UPC, ASIN, and Title) is sent securely to our backend server, located at https://pricecheck-backend.onrender.com.

The sole purpose of sending this information is to use it as a search query to find the same product at other online retailers and return price comparison data to you. The data is used for this single request and is not stored long-term or used for any other purpose.

Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third-party companies or services.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy in this location.
